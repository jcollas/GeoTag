<h1>Operating Instructions</h1>

<p>Launch Program.  Use the Open command from the File menu or ⌘O to select files
to modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files.  Such files can not be modified.  Dragging
or opening a folder will add all the files in the folder and any subfolders.</p>

<p>GPS track logs in the form of GPX files can also be opened or dragged onto
the table on the left side of the window.   Tracks are displayed in Red on
the map.</p>

<p>Select one or more images. When selecting multiple images the last image
selected is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the window).
Its location (if any) is marked on the map.  When multiple rows are selected
the latitude and longitude of the image displayed in the image well and marked
on the map location will be shown in yellow.</p>

<p>Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can also be changed by clicking elsewhere on the map. Hitting the delete
key will remove location information from all selected images.  You can Undo/Redo
image location changes.</p>

<p>Double click on a row in the table to change the date/time of the image.  A
window will open containing the current date/time and a date/time selector to
choose a new date/time.  Hitting return or clicking on the Change button will
note the changed time.  The image file will not be updated until changes are
saved.  Note: date/time changes are not currently in the undo/redo tree.</p>

<p>Select multiple images and then hit ⌘L, or Edit -> Modify Date/Time, or
right-click -> Modify Date/Time to open the change time window for the most
selected image.  If the time is changed a delta between the original date/time
and the updated date/time is calculated.  That delta is then applied to all
of the selected images.</p>

<p>Edit -> Locn from track or ⌘L will update the location of selected
images from the track log.  This is done by matching timestamps.   The track
log location with a time stamp less than or equal to the image time stamp is used
as the image location.  The location can them be tweaked by moving the marker.
If the image does not have a timestamp or of the timestamp is before all of
the points in the track log no location will be assigned.  WARNING: if the
track logs are from a time before the images were taken the locations will
be set to the last point in the track log.</p>

<p>You may double click on the map to zoom or you can use the zoom controls.
A pinch gesture works on trackpads.  Panning works as expeted.  There is also a
search bar.  Enter an address or partial address to center the map on the
desired location.  Zoom in/out as needed.</p>

<p>GeoTag can interpolate positions for images between two images with assigned
locations.   This might be useful where you know starting and ending locations
and would like to approximate where on the straight path between the two
other images may have been taken.  To use this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load a series of images to be tagged into GeoTag.</li>
<li>Assign a location to the first image in your series of images.</li>
<li>Assign a location to the last image in your series of images.</li>
<li>Select all images in the series from first to last.</li>
<li>Use the menu item "Edit -> Interpolate" to assign location to the
  intermediate images in your series of images.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
views.</p>

<p>If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the Save Map Layout
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location, style, and zoom level.</p>

<p>You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.</p>

<p>The original versions of images that have been changed and saved are in your
backup folder. A "backup folder" location is required.  If a backup folder is not
configured when GeoTag starts the program will open the preferences window for
you to select a location.</p>

<p>When saving geo location data to an image a copy of the un-edited image is
placed in the backup folder. If an image of the same name exists in that folder
a numbered suffix will be added to the name.   The name with the highest
numbered suffix is the most current backup (usually).</p>

<p>If the image file can not be copied to the backup location Geolocation
information will not be saved.   Better to be safe than sorry.</p>

</p>If there are no changes pending the list of images can be cleared using
File -> Clear image list, ⌘K.</p>

<p>A preference item exists to update GPS Date/Time stamps in the image
metadata whenever a location is modified.</p>

<p>Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Interpolate, Locn from track, and Clear Image List
can be accessed from a pop up menu by right or control clicking on an entry in
the list.</p>
