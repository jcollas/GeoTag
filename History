## GeoTag 4.5 (work in progress)

### New Features

* center the map (more or less) on a track when the track is opened.
* Add preference to select track color for GPX tracks.
* change GPX file loaded notification to a sheet attached to the GeoTag main
  window.  Dual monitor users would sometimes find the pop-up previously used
  on the wrong monitor, i.e. no the monitor they were looking at.
* exiftool 11.22

### Bug Fixes

* fix error that caused a "could not save images" alert even when all image
  data had been saved.
* handle GPX logs that include milliseconds the location timestamp.
* Fix location interpolition issues related to time zones.

## GeoTag 4.4

### New Features

* GeoTag can now read GPS track logs in the format of a GPX file and display
  tracks on the map.  This can help locate places where pictures were taken.
  Use Open (⌘-O) to select GPX files.  GPX files can also be dragged onto the
  table.
* Image location can be updated from a GPS track logs.  Select the images to
  update and use ⌘T, Edit -> Locn from track, or crtl-click -> Locn from track.
  Note: this can be time consuming depending upon the number of images selected
  and the number of track log point loaded.
* Images can now be opened with GeoTag.  You can select one or more images in
  finder and then right click and select the "Open With" option.  GeoTag will
  be one of app choices.
* Double clicking on a row in the table will open a window to update the
  timestamp of the image.  Timestamps are not changed during cut/copy/paste
  operations.
* A time delta can be applied to multiple images.   Select the images and
  use ⌘T, Edit -> Modify Date/Time, or ctrl-click -> Modify Date/Time.  Enter the
  new time for the selected image.  A time delta between the new and the existing
  date/time will be calculated. That delta is then applied to all selected items.
* Images can be selected and the map can be panned/zoomed while saving images.
  Images locations can not be edited until the save is complete.
* The last 10 map searches are saved across program runs. When Clicking on the
  search box saved search strings are indicated by a down arrow next to the
  Q icon. Click on the arrow next to open the menu of saved search strings.
* ExifTool version 11.10
* (internal) Swift 4.2, Xcode 10

### Bug fixes

* undoing a location update on an image that did not have a previous location
  resulted in a location of lat: 0, lon: 0. This has been fixed to restore the
  image to its "no location assigned" state.
* undoing all actions did not clear the window modified flag causing a "please
  save" message when window was closed/application terminated.
* No more beachball when saving large number of images.  Multiple images
  are saved in parallel, but the save process can still be quite slow.
* If GeoTag (or your computer) crashed with files opened and one or more of the
  opened files was moved to a different folder GeoTag would crash on attempts
  to re-open the file.

## GeoTag 4.3

### New Features

* Add ability to sort the table of images by column.  Clicking on a column
  header will sort the table by the contents of that column.  Clicking again
  will change the sort direction.
* ExifTool version 10.94

### Bug Fixes

* handle the case where the same file name is used for two images located in
  different folders.
* remove GPS date and time stamps when a location is removed.

## GeoTag 4.2

### New Features

* Update GPS Date and Time tags when updating location.   GPS timestamps are
  in GMT.  The procedure assumes the date and time the image was taken was correct
  for the time zone.  If your camera was set to the wrong time zone or set to
  UTC/GMT the GPS timestamp will be incorrect.  This feature is only enabled when
  the 'Update GPS Date/Time stamps' button is checked in program Preferences.
  **This feature is only available on macOS 10.11 or later**
  When running GeoTag on earlier versions of macOS the button state is ignored.
* ExifTool 10.76

### Bug Fixes

* Fix display of error reason when a backup folder can not be selected

## GeoTag 4.1 includes the following.

### New Features

* Map search
* Image backup handling
* Exiftool 10.67
* MIT Software License

### Bug Fixes

* GPS info validation
* pin no longer placed when double clicking on map
* pin no longer placed when dragging map
* Changes for Swift 4.0

## GeoTag 4.0

### New Features:

* Apple maps replace Google maps
* Exiftool is now built in
* Sandboxed for better security
* Image loading is many times faster
* Currently coded in Swift 3

## GeoTag 3.5

### New Features:

* (internal) update code to use Swift 2

### Bug fixes:

* Disable App Transport Security so the maps will load in OS X 10.11
  El Capitan

* location highlighting error fixed.  When assigning a location and then
  selecting another image the latitude and longitude are re-displayed in
  the standard color.

* map search box relocated such that it no longer covers the button used
  to exit street view.

## GeoTag 3.4

### New Features:

* Folders can now be dragged and dropped into the table. All non-duplicate files
  in the folder (and sub folders) will be added to the table for geolocation
  editing.

* Folders can also now be selected in the File -> Open dialog.

* Add ⌘K as a shortcut for the Clear image list menu option.  The command
  is ignored if any of the items in the list have been edited and not saved.

* Added a GeoTag preference to select a folder where original files will be
  saved in addition to the Trash. Files in the optional save folder with the same
  name as an image to be saved will NOT be overwritten.

* GeoTag can assign locations to images by interpolating between two points.
  See the operating instructions for more info.

### Bug fixes:

* Window size and split pane locations are now saved.   Restarting GeoTag
  should use the same layout as the previous invocation.

* When using drag-and-drop GeoTag enabled the drop only when the cursor was
  beyond the end of the table.  It will now allow a drop anywhere in the table.
  The added images will still be appended to the end of the table, not placed
  at the cursor location.

* Fixed crash that would occur when dragging movie files into GeoTag

* Fix handling of file systems that do not support the trash.  When the original
  version of an edited file can not be moved to the trash GeoTag will now display
  a warning and leave the original file in its original folder with '_original'
  appended to its name.   The warning will only be displayed once per GeoTag
  execution.

* Minimum window size reduced to fit on the smaller Macbook Air

## GeoTag 3.3

* Add a search field to the map.   Entering the name of a location and then
  hitting enter or clicking on the find button will center the map on the
  searched for location.

* Internal changes to match the requirements/features of Swift 1.2.  Xcode
  version 6.3 or later required to build from source.

## GeoTag 3.2

* Fix a class of bugs that would cause a crash when decoding optional image
  properties than weren't present.

## GeoTag 3.1

* Added ability to resize the image table, image, and map panes.  Otherwise
  the same as 3.0.

## GeoTag 3.0

This is a complete re-write of GeoTag for Mavericks and later

* written in swift
* Assumes exiftool exists in your run path
* Starting map location/zoom level may be saved
* Faster image loading

Use version 2.2 if your Mac is running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) though OS X 10.8
(Mountain Lion).  Use version 1.8 if your Mac is running OS X version 10.5
(Leopard)  or earlier
